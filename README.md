CALENDAR TO-DO LIST:
## ok final thots before i schlep ##

1. fuck event listeners but we have to use them so let's remove all 'onclick' things

2. make sure the right alerts come up when logging in/registering incorrectly

3. logout probably shouldnt just be refreshing but idk

4. creative portion
    - uhhh
    - category thing?
    - make it prettier?
    - google maps seems hard lol 

CALENDAR ERRORS:

1. I fixed the event printing error. it was glitching on events that had been created before you made all your changes.

2. sometimes, "successful registration" message shows more than once

3. my console shows an error saying the site is not secure. is that an issue?
