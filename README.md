CALENDAR TO-DO LIST:
## ok final thots before i schlep ##

1. fuck event listeners but we have to use them so let's remove all 'onclick' things --LETS NOT BOTHER, RUBRIC SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS

2. make sure the right alerts come up when logging in/registering incorrectly -- DONE

3. logout probably shouldnt just be refreshing but idk -- CHANGED. IT LOOKS BETTER NOW.

4. creative portion
    - uhhh
    - category thing -- IN PROGRESS
    - make it prettier? -- I DONT THINK THIS WOULD COUNT FOR CREATIVE PORTION POINTS
    - google maps seems hard lol -- YES, LETS NIX THIS
    - when username exists, give user suggestions of usernames similar to current username that doesnt exist
    - color code events based on which user's event it is
        - "choose color" option in register form, we could add this to the mySQL table
    - month view, week view, day view (I don't know how hard this would be because you did the view part)

5. Do we need to take out all 'vars'? --REMOVED ALL, NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ERRORING

6. Gillian started working on tokens, unclear where she left off. Do we need to send these tokens?

CALENDAR ERRORS:

1. I fixed the event printing error. it was glitching on events that had been created before you made all your changes.

2. sometimes "successful registration" message shows more than once

3. my console shows an error saying the site is not secure. is that an issue?

4. Gillian sucks at css so is putting style directly into css, change this later
