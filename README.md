CALENDAR TO-DO LIST:
## ok final thots before i schlep ##

1. fuck event listeners but we have to use them so let's remove all 'onclick' things --LETS NOT BOTHER, RUBRIC SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS

2. make sure the right alerts come up when logging in/registering incorrectly -- DONE

3. logout probably shouldnt just be refreshing but idk -- CHANGED. IT LOOKS BETTER NOW.

4. creative portion
    - uhhh
    - category thing?
    - make it prettier?
    - google maps seems hard lol 
    - when username exists, give user suggestions of usernames similar to current username that doesnt exist

5. Do we need to take out all 'vars'? --REMOVED ALL, NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ERRORING

CALENDAR ERRORS:

1. I fixed the event printing error. it was glitching on events that had been created before you made all your changes.

2. sometimes "successful registration" message shows more than once

3. my console shows an error saying the site is not secure. is that an issue?
